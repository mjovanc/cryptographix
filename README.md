# Cryptographix

![build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/njord-rs/njord/core.yml?branch=master)

Cryptographix is an interactive educational tool designed to visualize and simulate cryptographic algorithms and principles. 

**Explore the mechanics of:**

- Symmetric Encryption (AES, DES)
- Asymmetric Encryption (RSA, ECC)
- Hash Functions (SHA, MD5)
- Digital Signatures
- Key Exchange (Diffie-Hellman)
- Quantum Cryptography
- And more later on!

The purpose is to create an intuitive interface, where users can adjust variables, witness the encryption process, and learn through visualization, making complex cryptographic concepts accessible and engaging for learners of all levels. 

Open-source, community-driven, and crafted for both educational and explorative purposes.
